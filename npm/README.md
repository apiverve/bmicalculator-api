[Get started with the Quick Start Guide](https://docs.apiverve.com/quickstart?utm_source=npm&utm_medium=readme)

The BMI Calculator API documentation is found here: [https://docs.apiverve.com/ref/bmicalculator](https://docs.apiverve.com/ref/bmicalculator?utm_source=npm&utm_medium=readme).
You can find parameters, example responses, and status codes documented here.

### Setup

const api = new bmicalculatorAPI({
    api_key: '[YOUR_API_KEY]'
});
```

## Usage

---

### Perform Request

Using the API is simple. All you have to do is make a request. The API will return a response with the data you requested.

```javascript
var query = {
  weight: 70,
  height: 170,
  unit: "metric"
};

api.execute(query, function (error, data) {
    if (error) {
        return console.error(error);
    } else {
        console.log(data);
    }
});
```

---

### Using Promises

You can also use promises to make requests. The API returns a promise that you can use to handle the response.

```javascript
var query = {
  weight: 70,
  height: 170,
  unit: "metric"
};

api.execute(query)
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error(error);
    });
```

---

### Using Async/Await

You can also use async/await to make requests. The API returns a promise that you can use to handle the response.

```javascript
async function makeRequest() {
    var query = {
  weight: 70,
  height: 170,
  unit: "metric"
};

    try {
        const data = await api.execute(query);
        console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    }
}
```

## Example Response

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "error": null,
  "data": {
    "height": "170 cm",
    "weight": "70 kg",
    "bmi": 24.221453287197235,
    "risk": "Low risk",
    "summary": "This weight is normal and you are healthy.",
    "recommendation": "A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 falls within the 'normal' weight range according to the World Health Organization. This range is associated with the lowest health risk for conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. However, it's important to note that BMI is not a perfect measure as it does not account for muscle mass, bone density, overall body composition, and racial and sex differences. Therefore, while it's a useful starting point, it should not be the only measure of one's health."
  }
}
```
